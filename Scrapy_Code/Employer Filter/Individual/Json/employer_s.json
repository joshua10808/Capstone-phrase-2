Our College has a non-denominational Christian ethos and caters for children from a wide variety of Christian backgrounds and traditions.

Today Jesuit education continues to embrace change in appropriate ways, ensuring that a Jesuit education meets the needs of modern day learners, and develops learners who themselves will strive to contribute meaningfully and to excel.\n\nJesuits motto\n\nAMDG   \n\u201cAd Majorem Dei Gloriam\u201d   For the Greater Glory of God\n\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

It is a Catholic school in the Franciscan tradition and our community continues to be animated by the spirit of St Francis of Assisi.\n\nThe College comprises state-of-the-art facilities situated in a peaceful bushland setting with extensive grounds and is well-resourced to support a committed and professional teaching staff in the provision of quality Catholic education for students in the northern beaches.\n\nSt Anthony's strives to foster close relationships with parents and enjoys a positive partnership with St Anthony's Catholic Parish, which comes under the stewardship of the Franciscan Friars.\nIn 2015, the College introduced a Whole School Positive Behaviour Support Program. After consultation with parents, students and staff it was decided that we would use the acronym SHINE to outline our five key rules: S- Show Franciscan Spirit, H - Help and Respect,  - Invest in Learning, N - Never Give Up, E - Ensure Safety.\nPrincipal Welcome\nello and welcome to the St Anthony\u2019s Catholic College community. I hope you spend some time exploring our website as it gives a good insight into what we are about. \n\nMany schools set out to provide their students with a full rounded education including physical, academic, spiritual, emotional and social elements. I believe St Anthony\u2019s is extremely good at this. We come from the rich Catholic, Franciscan faith that highly values every living creature. We are a welcoming community embracing all the wonders of learning.\n\nOur College Motto is \u201cLet Your Light Shine\u201d. As children of God we are called to let our light shine.\n\n\u201cNo one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may see the light.\u201d\nLuke 8:16\n\n This means we want all of our community to SHINE. We all have talents and it is our God given right to develop these to the best of our abilities. This is what St. Anthony\u2019s Catholic College endeavours to do. It is a shared approach with the parents and carers being both valued and necessary in the process if our children are to reach their true potential.\n\nThe College is on two vast campuses. Padua (Primary) set on 5.5 hectares and Assisi (Secondary) set on 12.7 hectares. Padua has recently undergone a face-lift with new buildings catering for the ever growing needs of a contemporary and comprehensive primary education. Assisi is only ten years old and boasts great resources, delivering a varied curriculum.\n\nOur greatest asset at the College though, is our dedicated and very professional staff. They are a vital part of this learning environment and continue to look for ways to better meet the needs of the community.\n\nThe College has an active Parents and Friends' Association (P&F) and College Board who meet regularly, providing a voice for our parents and carers.\n\nSt. Anthony\u2019s is a learning community; a faith community and importantly, a community built on love.\n\nBarry Horner\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

However, the new version of football, which we have come to know as Australian Rules, began in Melbourne in 1858 and one of its founders, Henry Harrison, visited Adelaide to promote the game in 1860. At a meeting at the Globe Inn (where Myer now stands in Rundle Mall) a local football club was formed, known as the Adelaide Football Club.\n\nThis new club arranged matches between its members, who lived north and south of the River Torrens, and with another group known as Collegians, whose members attended one of Adelaide's private colleges. Other clubs were soon formed at Modbury (1862), Port Adelaide (1870), Gawler, Woodville, Kensington, and Willunga.\n\nIn 1875/76, a number of players broke away from the old Adelaide Football Club to form what became known as the South Adelaide Football Club.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

But it was in the adjoining, 24sqm bakery that he spent most of his time. Kerry would watch the local baker kneading, stretching and shaping dough, before putting it in the oven where it was transformed into golden loaves. He didn\u2019t know it yet, but that experience would be the beginning of Sonoma.\nYears later, on a whim, Kerry leased the old bakery for $1,000 per year and restored it with his sons Andrew and Christian.

In 1910 the Margaret River Progress Association wrote to the Minister for Lands requesting a townsite be declared at \"the Upper Margaret Bridge\". The reason given was that \"the district is likely to be dotted with public buildings several miles apart in the near future if a townsite is not made available shortly\". The District Surveyor who inspected the area preferred an area near the lower bridge on Caves Road, but this land was not available. Lots were surveyed in 1912, and the Townsite of Margaret River gazetted in 1913. In 1918 the name of the townsite was changed to \"Margaret\", but it was changed back to Margaret River in 1927, due to local usage of the name always being Margaret River.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

One day he had finally told his supplier that if the supplier could not do better he would do it himself, needless to say his supplier laughed at him. Bob was not the sort of person to be put off in the pursuit of quality and opened the paper the next day and found an advertisement for an anodising plant for sale. The anodising Plant was used to anodise the Raco range of Aluminium Cookware and was now being decommissioned, Bob turned up eager to have a look and negotiated the sale to buy the plant. He now owned an anodising plant but had no factory in which to install it and no idea how to put it together or operate it.\n\nUndaunted Bob negotiated rent on a factory at 43 Sydenham Road, Brookvale NSW and commenced installation of the plant. Whilst installing the plant word had got around that a new anodiser was about to commence operations and number of people got in contact with Bob, some were customers, some were people that became employees and the anodising plant came into operation. Today such a decision would be considered foolhardy but not in these times and by sheer will and hardwork Bob had an anodising plant that was capable of giving him the quality bright finishes that he required for his Shower screen product.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website"},
