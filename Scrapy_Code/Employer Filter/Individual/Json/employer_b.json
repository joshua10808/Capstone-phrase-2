Not all new businesses succeed. Before focusing on how to start a business, you need to be sure you are ready to start one. Consider how the potential personal costs of setting up a business, such as a reduced income, and less free time, could affect you and your family, and how you can prepare yourself to meet these challenges.\n\n\nPreparing for a new business\nStarting a business requires careful planning and preparation. Increase your business skills and knowledge so you will know how to start a business that has the greatest chance of succeeding. Information, training and advice is readily available on all aspects of business management such as business planning, resource and risk management, budgeting and decision making.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

About a six hour drive from Mount Isa, the town is located on the Gulf of Carpentaria, on the Albert River, about 40km south of the coast.

These \u2018country orders\u2019 are then delivered for a fee by the mail service or other transport providers.\n\nMost roads in the townships are sealed and some have curb and channel (gutters).

Whether you\u2019re purchasing or refinancing a residential dwelling, building your dream home, or buying a block of land, Bluebay Home Loans can help. Often when other lenders can\u2019t.\n\nEstablished in 2008, our goal was always to provide a viable alternative to the big Australian banks. It\u2019s our whole reason for being.\n\nWhy? Because for more than a century, they\u2019ve had virtually no competition in Australia. They\u2019re too used to having the upper hand, and consumers are paying the price. Almost without exception, traditional home loans lack choice and flexibility, so they simply don\u2019t meet the real-life needs of everyday borrowers. Needless to say, customer service has gone out the window too.\n\nWe\u2019re here to change all that.\n\nIt all starts with great customer service. We understand that applying for a home loan may be the biggest financial decision you ever make. But that doesn\u2019t mean the process, itself, has to be hard! We want it to be easy for you.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

Blackall is an attractive town and is classed as a remote community with a population on approximately 1560 people. Tambo is a rural community with a population of around 620 people.\n\nThe Blackall-Tambo Regional Council has an extensive history of cattle, sheep and wool production, with having the well known Jackie Howe live and work in the area. Today the cattle production has overhauled sheep as the major industry. The Region's economy has also diversified into other industries including cypress pine sawmilling and tourism, and has a solid base of retail and general services.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},
