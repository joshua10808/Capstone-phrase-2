We are a Catholic School with the expressed aim of living out the values of the Gospel. We are a Loreto school in the spirit of Mary Ward that believes strongly \u2018that women in time will come to do great things.\u2019\nThe History of Loreto College Ballarat\n\nThe Loreto school in Ballarat was the first Loreto school in Australia, established by Mother Gonzaga Barry and her community of sisters in 1875 following an invitation from the Bishop of Ballarat to establish a school for girls.\nMother Gonzaga had come to Australia from Ireland instilled with the educational vision of Mary Ward, who more than 400 years ago was committed to education for women built on \u2018the qualities of freedom, justice and sincerity\u2019.\n\nHolding close her faith and these ideals, Mother Gonzaga established Loreto schools in Ballarat vowing to \u2018educate the whole child\u2019 so that every girl, despite her background, was given \u2018\u2026 a chance of distinguishing herself\u2026\u2019\n\nIt was Mother Gonzaga\u2019s view that offering girls a rounded education, including the sciences, \u2018would bring about reforms and improvements not yet dreamt of\u2019.\n\nMother Gonzaga\u2019s educational endeavors came to include two schools for girls in Ballarat, at Mary\u2019s Mount and Dawson Street, as well as primary schools. From these beginnings, Mother Gonzaga\u2019s extraordinary vision and ability also saw Loreto schools established in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.\n\nIn 1978, Dawson Street Day School and Mary\u2019s Mount were formally amalgamated to form Loreto College Ballarat, with Years 7 \u2013 8 at Dawson Street and Years 9 \u2013 12 at Sturt Street \u2013 Mary\u2019s Mount. In 2007, Loreto\u2019s junior and senior campuses were combined on the one campus at Sturt Street following the construction of the Mary Ward Centre for Years 7 -8.  The Mary\u2019s Mount Centre, a performing arts centre housing a 500 seat theatre, music and dance studios, classrooms and multimedia labs, was opened in 2015. The building of the Mary\u2019s Mount Centre provided space for the redesign and development of a new contemporary learning space, the Mulhall Centre. Year 9 students commenced classes in the Mulhall Centre in 2016\nSpiritual and Religious Development\n\nA vigorous belief in the capacity and responsibility of women to contribute significantly to society and the church underlies the emphasis on our tradition of the education of girls.\n\nLoreto College is a Catholic school and it is important for us as educators to join parents in guiding the spiritual and religious development of students \u2013 both as individuals and as part of the community in which they live, learn and pray.\n\nIn Religious Education classes, Loreto College students explore the teachings of our faith through the Awakenings religious education program, as well as participation in Liturgy, Prayer, Retreats and Action for Justice and Peace.\n\nLoreto College strives to be a place where the extraordinary reality of being \u2018made in the image and likeness of God\u2019 and being able to \u2018find God in all things\u2019 underpins and brings vitality to all that students undertake. It is within this context that the Loreto College community attempts to nurture students so they may see God in all that they do and experience.\n\nWe do however, recognize that in today\u2019s open and pluralistic society, there may be frequent questions and challenges raised by our students which we seek to deal with seriously as we attempt to support our students\u2019 search for a faith to which they can honestly assent and commit.\n\nIt is our faith in God and the spiritual traditions left to us by Mary Ward and Mother Gonzaga Barry and their faith filled companions which allow us to encourage students to explore the contemporary world as part of their individual spiritual journey\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

Mandy (Toronto) and Mark (Melbourne) met while living in Taiwan (Tainan). Their love for fries drew them closer, and their disdain for nasty frozen chemical fries inspired them to create the perfect fry.\n\nThey wanted fresh potatoes, thick but not too thick, crispy but not too crunchy, delicious and saucy, the mission began.\n\nIt was the beginning of a vegetarian fast food revolution.\n\nLanding in Melbourne in August, 2004, they decided to take the best fries you will ever try to the people! What better way than a mobile chip van now all they needed was a name.\n\nThis is where Sam (Mark\u2019s brother) comes sizzling into the story. Being a creative wiz, he crowned the venture LORD OF THE FRIES.\n\nThe Lord was born!!\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},
