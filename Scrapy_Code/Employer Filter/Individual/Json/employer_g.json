As a young man in the cotton insurance business, Guy Carpenter discovered that the business was haphazard and reactive. A year of big losses pushed the next year\u2019s premiums too high; a lucky year sent prices down, often exposing insurers and reinsurers to more risk than they had bargained for.\n\nCarpenter had a better idea: rates based on a rolling average of losses over many years. The rolling average identified the signal in the noise of year-to-year fluctuations. The \u201cCarpenter Plan\u201d enabled insurance of all losses over a certain level. For the first time, producers and insurers could anticipate rates and manage costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe insight that data \u2013 the more the better \u2013 could help clients anticipate perils and measure risks put Guy Carpenter on a trajectory that is still transforming the industry.\n \n\nIn 1923 Carpenter met with cotton insurance brokers Henry W. Marsh and Donald R. McLennan during a transatlantic crossing. The merged firm would take the nascent science of quantitative analytics beyond cotton. Along with quantitative precision, precise language became a hallmark of the firm. Carpenter insisted on clarity: Contracts were more inclusive, citing only those perils that were excluded. Contract language written by Carpenter himself still appears in reinsurance contracts issued by our company and its competitors around the world.\n\nGuy Carpenter continues to serve some of its original clients \u2013 and clients that have come to us in every decade since. For them, and those who join us today, the durability of the firm\u2019s leadership is more than a fact. It is a promise.\n\nWho will you trust with the future of your business?\n\nAs a leading integrated solutions provider to the (re)insurance industry, Guy Carpenter delivers a powerful combination of broking expertise, strategic advisory services, and industry-leading analytics.\n\nAt Guy Carpenter, leadership goes deeper than management. Over 2,000 professionals work here. Most of them are the very best in the world in highly specialized fields. We are an organization of innovators: in the transfer of risk, in new forms of capital, in actuarial science and analytics.

{"employer_url": "https://www.seek.com.au/companies/gold-coast-drug-council-797509", "employer_name": "Gold Coast Drug Council", "employer_info": "Our History\n\nIn 1985, the Social Issues in Australia Survey was conducted to obtain benchmark data on attitudes to drugs, and led to the establishment of The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, following a Special Premiers\u2019 Conference in Melbourne. The conference brought together treatment providers from across Australia, including a small group of people who were operating residential treatment programs as Therapeutic Communities (TCs) but who had remained largely unconnected from each other.\n\nIn 1986, following the Special Premiers\u2019 Conference, this group met at Odyssey House in Melbourne and agreed to the establishment of the Australian (later to become the Australasian) Therapeutic Communities Association (ATCA). ATCA was established as a membership association whose purpose was to bring together Therapeutic Communities from across Australia & New Zealand and to support and promote the TC as a method of treatment for substance dependency.\n\nFrom 1986 \u2013 2006, ATCA operated as a voluntary group with an elected Board of Management, providing peer support and training to its members and working together to ensure quality standards of treatment were maintained. In 2006, the Association received a grant from the Australian Government Department of Health & Ageing which provided funding to establish a secretariat to, \u201cprovide information aimed at improving the quality of TC services in the areas of treatment, research, education and support\u201d. This grant facilitated the employment of an Executive Officer to take responsibility for fulfilling these goals.\n\nSince 2006, ATCA membership has grown by 70%, with ATCA members managing 69 TCs in community and custodial settings across Australia and New Zealand. ATCA members also provide a range of non-residential services, and over the course of a year will provide residential services to over 9,000 people and out-client support to a further 24,000. These services include detoxification units, family, gambling and mental health counselling, child care facilities, family support programs, exit housing and outreach services.\n\nTCs are a proven model of effective treatment for a range of issues, including substance use and mental health, and have been shown to be especially effective for people with coexisting mental health and alcohol and other drug (AOD) conditions and those affected by chronic substance dependency. The research base is steadily growing through active partnerships between member agencies and universities. Of particular note are the partnerships with the Universities of New South Wales, Newcastle, Wollongong, Monash and Deakin, with a growing number of papers published in quality peer reviewed journals in Australia and internationally.\n\nATCA Standard\n\nThe support of the Australian Government through the Department of Health was further enhanced in 2008, with funding to develop the ATCA Standard.  The ATCA Standard was first launched in 2009 and since that time has been trialed and modified through peer review. In 2014 the ATCA Standard for Therapeutic Communities and Residential Rehabilitation Services was certified by the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand (JAS-ANZ) and is now available on the ATCA website (http://www.atca.com.au/atca-standard/) . Also available on the website is the Interpretive Guide to assist TCs and residential services wishing to undertake a review or accreditation against the ATCA Standard. \n\nTo navigate your way to the ATCA Standard, click on the Members tab at the top of this page, and then on ATCA Standard, where you will find a copy of the ATCA Standard and the ATCA Interpretive Guide, together with information on the ATCA Quality Portal, which has been developed in partnership with Breaking New Ground.\n\nOur Vision\n\nThe Therapeutic Community model of treatment is recognised and embraced by community and governments across Australasia.\n\nOur Mission\n\nWe support, represent and advocate for programs that restore a sense of self, hope and belonging through the use of the Therapeutic Community model of treatment.\n\nOur purpose\n\u2022To advance the Therapeutic Communities Model in Australasia\n\u2022To promote community awareness of the Therapeutic Communities Model of treatment in Australasia\n\u2022To ensure consistency in approach through the application of the ATCA Essential Elements in practice\n\u2022To encourage capacity building in Therapeutic Communities through a variety of peer support and professional development opportunities\n\u2022To advocate for recognition and funding for Therapeutic Communities in Australasia\n\u2022To encourage and support ongoing research into the Therapeutic Communities Model\n\u2022To support and network with organisations and individuals interested in, or aspiring to become members of the ATCA\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},
