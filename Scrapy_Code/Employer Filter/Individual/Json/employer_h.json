The Hope Downs mine has commenced, (November 2007) with 50 percent partners Rio Tinto Iron Ore (RTIO).  A second mine at Hope Downs 1 South commenced November 2008.\n\nThe Hope Downs Project represents an important milestone for the company.  For the first time, the HPPL group has retained a significant equity stake in a developed world class project, indeed now two mines.  This had been a long term vision of HPPL\u2019s founder Mr Lang Hancock, and shared by his daughter, Gina Rinehart the current chairman of HPPL, which for the first time is being realised.\n\nWith the capability and experience gained through the development of earlier projects and bankable feasibility studies such as Marandoo and more recently Hope Downs, Hancock is looking forward to a productive future involving the successful development of its next major iron ore project, Roy Hill 1, and its steaming coal projects in Queensland and other projects in the HPPL group portfolio.

Bob and his three brothers were fortunate to be technically involved with the later part of Dick\u2019s career and Bob, gaining an appetite for engineering and marketing of new concepts, became General Manager for the Ifield group of companies. The company became interested in the challenges presented by mining primarily through a relationship with Charles Deamer, the chief engineer for Noyes Brothers. Charles became Bob\u2019s second mentor and the Ifield companies became deeply involved in the development of transmission systems for several new machines conceived by Charles and hydraulic systems for mining machines generally. The Ifield Company was wound down in 1988 following a technical successful project concerning a new Skid Steer Transmission system for the M113 military vehicles and the Ifield brothers then pursued different interests. Bob recommenced Hyden Engineering in 1991 and has since been joined by family members Craig and Ben. Initially, the core activity was to be the repair of hydraulic and lubrication equipment and purpose designed software was developed in-house, to track the \u2018root cause of failure\u2019 to provide a key maintenance management tool. \n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

The first inhabitants of the area were the Djura Balug indigenous Australian tribe who spoke the Jardwadjali language.  The Wimmera district was previously know by the aboriginal word \u201cBogambilor\u201d, meaning place of flowers, because the area was covered with a dense scrub of wattles.\n\nMajor Thomas Mitchell was the first European to pass through the area, naming the Wimmera River in 1836.  The town itself was named by James Monckton Darlot, the first squatter to take up land in 1842.  It was named after his native town in Horsham, England.\n\nThe Horsham Post Office opened in 1848 with an elaborate building and clock tower erected in 1880.\n\nIn the 1870s, when squatting runs were divided up for smaller selection, a large German population settled in the area and many descendants still remain today.\n\nThe main railway from Melbourne reached Horsham in 1879 and was later extended to Adelaide, South Australia, whilst a branch line west to Carpolac began in 1887 and closed in 1988.\n\nThe Horsham Borough Council and the Wimmera Shire operated the McKenzie Creek Tramway from the town to a stone quarry, some eight kilometres to the south.  The horse tramway opened in 1885 and ceased operating in 1927.\n\nMajor flooding affected the area in 1894 and again in 1909, with the Wimmera River reaching 3.87 metres.\n\nGreen Lake was constructed in 1933, with a capacity of 5,350 ML.  It was originally planned as an agricultural irrigation reservoir.\n\nHorsham was officially declared a town in 1932 and a city in 1949.\n\nThe Black Saturday bushfires of 2009 were devastating, with 5,700 hectares burnt around the city\u2019s fringe including the golf club and eight homes.  Horsham experienced significant flooding in successive years in 2010 and 2011.  During these events, the Wimmera River reached 3.32 metres and 4.71 metres, respectively.  The 2011 event was particularly severe, with the Wimmera River reaching a record peak level.  Over 1,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters divided the city and damaged 600 houses, pushing up to a metre of water into parts of the central business district.\n\nThe municipality currently boasts a population of 19,774 and is aptly named \"The Capital of the Wimmera\".\nHorsham Rural City is part of the tier of government that touches people most closely - Local Government.\n\nIn Victoria, there are 79 councils, representing around 5 million people.\n\nLocal Government in Victoria is administered under the Local Government Act 1989, which provides a framework for the establishment and operation of councils.\n\nTo learn more how Council work, how they make decisions, what their key functions are and how they are funded, please read...\nGuide to Local Government\nLocal Government Act\n\nHorsham Rural City Council has seven elected Councillors who are elected every four years by the residents of the municipality.  Voting is conducted via postal vote, with the most recent electon held on 27 October 2012 and the next election to be held on 22 October 2016.\n\nThe Mayor is elected for a one year period each November and is voted in by the Councillors.  \n\nThe seven Councillors are the elected representatives of all residents and ratepayers across the municipality.  They have responsibility for setting the strategic direction for the Horsham Rural City Council, policy development, identifying service standards and monitoring performance across the organisation. The Councillors do not represent a particular area or \"ward\", they are elected to lead and represent the whole municipality.  Each Councillor has a portfolio of local committes that they attend, providing a valuable link between the community and Council.  The following link provides further details about Horsham Rural City Councillors: http://www.hrcc.vic.gov.au/council/councillors\n\nCouncil meetings are held on the first and third Monday of every month (excluding January) at the Civic Centre in Horsham commencing at 5.30 pm.\n\nMeetings are open to the general public.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

Our commitment is to look deeply into your project and find a design solution that offers you the best value, whatever that may be: - attracting customers or buyers, increasing the productivity of your staff, or inspiring the community in which you live.\nWe strive for a solution that will excel - practically and economically - responding to each individual project with the conditions of the brief, site and context.\n\nOur architects, planners and associates, working in five capital cities, represent decades of experience and skill across all design disciplines. We also offer research and advisory services to assist you with evidence-based decision making.\n\nWe collaborate with local and international partners such as UN Studio, Foster + Partners, Silver Thomas Hanley and Cox Architecture to stimulate and challenge our ideas. Firms that believe only in themselves fail to evolve and quickly become remnants. Our collaborative objectives are to listen, learn and share the art of design with clients, colleagues and stakeholders. For example, our sustainable design professionals partner with leading experts in the field of sustainability in finding new approaches to adaptable housing, sustainable office design and resilient cities.\n\nInspiring design is the result of precise thinking. We engage important stakeholders and measure our ideas against the world\u2019s best before we put pencil to paper.\n\nHames Sharley is a knowledge-based organisation. We take pride in making sure our employees are constantly at the forefront of their areas of expertise. We encourage and support them to undertake international and national study tours, workshops, seminars and market research participation on a constant basis. Our staff culture is creative and dynamic.\n\nAs they share the extensive knowledge gained from these forums, many have become thought leaders in their fields. Ideas are cross-pollinated throughout our offices; shared, debated and discussed in detail.\n\nWe share this knowledge and ideas with you, our clients.\n\nIn doing so, we work with you to achieve a \u2018larger vision\u2019 for your project.\n\nOur approach is what makes us unique and has led to our design being recognised by our peers and peak industry bodies such as:\n+The Institute of Architects \n+The Planning Institute of Australia \n+The Property Council of Australia \n+The Master Builders Association \n+Urban Development Institute of Australia \n\n\n\nand more importantly, our clients who honour us with their repeat business\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},
