Every trader on the floor had a three letter acronym for identification\u2014Don chose his initials, DRW, and the name stuck. Over the past 25 years, DRW has expanded globally while staying true to what has always set us apart\u2026our ability to identify and capture opportunities by leveraging technology, research and risk management\nOur Approach\n\nWe characterize our trading activity as following three general approaches \u2014\n\n\u2022Liquidity providing: making markets, buying and selling products every day, with execution on a trading floor, over the phone and electronically \n\u2022Risk taking: doing our homework, formulating a view and putting on a position. Some positions are held for a few days, some for a few months or even years.\n\u2022Latency sensitive: combining research and risk management with superior technology and execution\n\n \n\nTrading in any asset class might include just one of these or may bring together all three; it all depends on what we see as the right strategy in that market. Our knowledge of the markets, pricing and modeling skills, risk management, and leading technology work together to create liquidity, improve market efficiency, and capture opportunities\nOur Culture\n\nDRW combines the best of both worlds:  the opportunity and spirit of a startup and the stability of an established, experienced firm. Our employees work hard to solve interesting problems, and their results are rewarded. We value continuous learning\u2014from our outcomes, from the environment and from each other. It\u2019s a place of high expectations, deep curiosity, and constant collaboration, with some of the smartest, most passionate people you\u2019ll meet.\nOur trading is diverse, and it\u2019s this diversification that sets us apart. We trade across many asset classes and instruments, using a variety of models. Our approach is to combine the disciplines of risk management, research and technology to create optimal trading and investment strategies within the regulatory framework. \n\nTrading\n\nOur own way\n\n\n\nWe trade for our own account in major markets across the globe. No outside investors. No third party funds. So we can be innovative and nimble, while using our market experience to prudently manage risk. We have the team and infrastructure in place to drive business forward without the inefficiencies that hold back other organizations. Not many places do things like we do, and we like it that way. \n\nTechnology\n\nCore to everything we do\n\n\n\nOur approach to technology is ambitious, yet pragmatic. Our teams are empowered to solve challenging business problems, collaborating with equally motivated traders and researchers to engineer the right solutions for the job. The result? Inventive, industry leading systems deployed across the globe.\n\nReal Estate\n\nAnother trade\n\n\n\nIn 2009, we started the real estate arm of DRW and have since established Convexity Properties. We look at real estate investments as another way to trade\u2026the same analysis with a longer horizon. We take the lead developer role on many projects, as well as partner with leading development and architecture firms to bring increased value and new purpose to our properties.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

Forever.\n\nWhen Dermalogica meets skin, skin health is redefined. Dermalogica is the number one choice of skin care professionals and consumers worldwide. Why? Because for over 25 years, we've been dedicated to delivering skin health results through education, innovation, and professional recommendation, not through sparkly packaging, promises of miracle cures, or overblown hype.\n\nEducation First\n\nWhile the Dermalogica story begins in 1986, the force of change in the industry started in Los Angeles, circa 1983. Jane Wurwand, a tenured, United Kingdom-trained skin therapist new to the American \"esthetician\" industry, recognized that continuing skin and body therapy education was practically non-existent in the United States. While her training had been comprehensive and serious, US students entered the industry licensed yet under-trained, and worse, under-respected.\n\nJane put her education in action, opening a small classroom in Marina del Rey, California under the name The International Dermal Institute (IDI). She invited licensed skin therapists to get hands-on with the postgraduate training so critical to making them competitive in the business. Today, IDI is considered the international gold-standard for postgraduate skin and body therapy training with 37 locations worldwide.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

The Directors of The Grange identified in the early 2000\u2019s that to remain a viable business and maintain a significant community asset that amalgamation with a strong local club would be in their best interests. After lengthy member consultation this became a reality in June 2006, amalgamating with Dapto Leagues\n\nThe club\u2019s primary purpose is to promote the game of Golf; however as part of the amalgamation in 2006 the club constitutions became the same as Dapto Leagues Club. Of which the clubs purpose is to provide facilities for, promote, encourage and assist social, literary, sporting and other recreational and cultural activities among members and their guests. Also to assist generally in fostering, developing, promoting, conducting and encouraging Rugby League Football and all forms of sports, athletics, recreations, physical culture and cultural pursuits in the Dapto district and elsewhere.\n\nThe success of this partnership has offered the membership of both clubs access to a range of different facilities, and has enhanced the benefits of being a member of both clubs, whilst ensuring that both clubs will be around for many years into the future. The expected growth of the population in the area, will see our new residents inherit a range of facilities and benefits second to none.\n\nThe Course\n\n\u201cThe picturesque Mullet Creek winds its way through the course, coming into play on 11 holes and at its most penal on the back nine.\u201d\nThe gently undulating and more heavily tree-lined back nine presents The Grange\u2019s most memorable holes. The stretch from the par 4 12th to the short par 4 15th \u2013 on land linked to the main course by a walkway under the Princes Highway \u2013 is superb.\n The land these holes have been laid out over rolls and dips far more then any of the earlier holes, which makes them more exciting. The 532 metre par-5 13th is a brute \u2013 not just for its length but also its demand for accuracy to avoid the rows of tall trees lining the fairway.\n\nWhile The Grange\u2019s longest hole requires straight hitting, so does its shortest. The 146 metre par 3 18th is the club\u2019s signature hole \u2013 and for good reason. Standing on the tee there is only one thing between you the front edge the green \u2013 the cool, flowing waters of Mullet Creek. There is a short fairway to the left of the water and in front of putting surface, which is heavily bunkered. This hole is easily affected by wind and anything from a 3-iron to a wedge could be used to find the small undulating green.\u201d\nExtract from \u201cGolf Australia\u201d.\n\nThe Club House\n\nThe Grange Club House offers a modern contemporary feel with a fully stocked bar, affordable brassiere dining that is open seven days for lunch and Friday for dinner, a barbecue area and the award-winning 2 venues \u2013 The Grange for events, Weddings, Engagements, Birthdays and Seminars.\n\nYou can enjoy a beverage, lunch, dinner or event facilities whilst overlooking the tenth fairway and beyond to the beautiful escarpment.\n\nGolf apparel is also available in the clubs Pro Shop where a range of Foot Joy shoes, clothing for men and ladies, plus an extensive range of Titlist golf clubs are available\n\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},
