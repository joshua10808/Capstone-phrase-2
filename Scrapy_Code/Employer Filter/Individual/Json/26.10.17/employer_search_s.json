Today Jesuit education continues to embrace change in appropriate ways, ensuring that a Jesuit education meets the needs of modern day learners, and develops learners who themselves will strive to contribute meaningfully and to excel.\n\nJesuits motto\n\nAMDG   \n\u201cAd Majorem Dei Gloriam\u201d   For the Greater Glory of God\n\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

However, the new version of football, which we have come to know as Australian Rules, began in Melbourne in 1858 and one of its founders, Henry Harrison, visited Adelaide to promote the game in 1860. At a meeting at the Globe Inn (where Myer now stands in Rundle Mall) a local football club was formed, known as the Adelaide Football Club.\n\nThis new club arranged matches between its members, who lived north and south of the River Torrens, and with another group known as Collegians, whose members attended one of Adelaide's private colleges. Other clubs were soon formed at Modbury (1862), Port Adelaide (1870), Gawler, Woodville, Kensington, and Willunga.\n\nIn 1875/76, a number of players broke away from the old Adelaide Football Club to form what became known as the South Adelaide Football Club.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

But it was in the adjoining, 24sqm bakery that he spent most of his time. Kerry would watch the local baker kneading, stretching and shaping dough, before putting it in the oven where it was transformed into golden loaves. He didn\u2019t know it yet, but that experience would be the beginning of Sonoma.\nYears later, on a whim, Kerry leased the old bakery for $1,000 per year and restored it with his sons Andrew and Christian.

However, before the end of the first year, enrolments had more than doubled and Sirius College completed its first year with 60 students.\nIn 1999, (former) Mildura Campus started its operation also as a primary school.\nTwo years later in 2001, Keysborough Campus (formerly known as Dandenong Campus) started its operation to cater for primary students with the intention of offering junior secondary education in following years.\nIn 2005, Shepparton Campus commenced its operation as a primary school. In the same year, Meadow Fair Campus (formerly known as Upfield Campus) also commenced its operation at its temporary location in Upfield Campus to offer year 7-12 educational programs for boys only.\nIn 2010, Ibrahim Dellal, Sunshine Campus commenced its operation as a primary school, initially. There were additional changes occurred in 2010. Meadow Fair Campus was relocated to its new site in the same year. Mildura Campus stopped its operation as a normal primary school to commence operating as a tutoring centre and weekend language school.\nIn 2011, Geelong Campus was relocated and merged with the Ibrahim Dellal, Sunshine Campus, offering co-educational programs for years Prep \u2013 10.\nIn January 2013, the school name was changed from \u2018ISIK College\u2019 to \u2018Sirius College\u2019.\nIn 2015, Dallas Campus opened as the sixth Sirius College and grade 6 students of Eastmeadows Campus located there.\nSince its first operation, Sirius College has grown beyond expectations to meet the tremendous demand of the community and has managed to reach over 2300 student enrolments across all campuses in 2015. This number includes Australian children from all denominations. This was made possible by the full support of the community and their abiding concern and generosity.\nToday, Sirius College plays a leading role in educating young generations with its academic excellence and disciplined education; and continues to contribute to the future of Australia.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website"},

The Margaret River itself was named in 1831 by John Garrett Bussell on one of his early exploration forays. The name is first shown on a map of the region published in 1839.\n\nMargaret River was declared a townsite in 1910 and gazetted on February 7th, 1913. In 1910 the Margaret River Progress Association wrote to the Minister for Lands requesting a townsite be declared at \"the Upper Margaret Bridge\". The reason given was that \"the district is likely to be dotted with public buildings several miles apart in the near future if a townsite is not made available shortly\". The District Surveyor who inspected the area preferred an area near the lower bridge on Caves Road, but this land was not available. Lots were surveyed in 1912, and the Townsite of Margaret River gazetted in 1913. In 1918 the name of the townsite was changed to \"Margaret\", but it was changed back to Margaret River in 1927, due to local usage of the name always being Margaret River.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

With extensive experience in the diesel heavy equipment field covering all aspects of the mining and earthmoving industries, Graham Sharp has developed the business with the major focus being on high quality workmanship and customer service.\n\nHence the company motto \"Quality People -Quality Service\"\n\nSharps main workshop is situated in Mackay at Presto Avenue in the Outer Harbour. The site is a five acre block that comprises a boilermakers workshop, machine shop, hardstand and one of only a few companies that offer a fully air-conditioned contamination free workshop for engines and components overhauls and rebuilds. \n\nIn 2007 Sharps established a workshop in Dalby. Situated just west of Queensland' s Great South East, the workshop provides a diesel fitting and boilermaking facility as well as field service to cater to our clients within the Surat Basin and surrounding areas.\n\nIn August 2010 Sharps established a branch at Rutherford in the Hunter Valley NSW, supplying the same level of heavy earth moving equipment repairs as the Queensland operations have successfully done.\n\nSharps historic focus has been on providing the best possible service specialising in earthmoving equipment. We have also expanded that service to cater to overburden drill rigs, from full rig to mast overhauls through to general service and repair. Compressors and drill bit testing, support and products complete the comprehensive service offered to this unique market within our mining industry. \n\nIn this climate of proactive measures to support the commitment of all stakeholders with regards to the issue of Health and Safety, Sharps are specialising in fabrication and fit-out of Fatal Risk Control Protocol's (FRCPs) requirements. We have completed many designs, modifications and fit-outs to a full range of machinery to ensure site compliance to the highest standards.\n\nSharps are proud of our long-term achievements within the mining industry. We are also conscious of our ability to grow with the trends and new concepts as evidenced with our expansion and, while our primary focus has been on the mining sector, we are also providing services to the agricultural and civil industries.\n\nMore detailed information on each of the divisions within Sharps capable of servicing your needs is accessible via our web page links.

This applies especially to their growth in an informed appreciation of their Faith as an integral and essential part of that broad education.\n\nThough our student population is drawn mostly from those who have attended local Catholic Primary Schools, and whose families have been actively supportive of their sons' ongoing education in the Catholic faith through consistent involvement in their parish communities, consideration is always given to students who can demonstrate special circumstances.

One day he had finally told his supplier that if the supplier could not do better he would do it himself, needless to say his supplier laughed at him. Bob was not the sort of person to be put off in the pursuit of quality and opened the paper the next day and found an advertisement for an anodising plant for sale. The anodising Plant was used to anodise the Raco range of Aluminium Cookware and was now being decommissioned, Bob turned up eager to have a look and negotiated the sale to buy the plant. He now owned an anodising plant but had no factory in which to install it and no idea how to put it together or operate it.\n\nUndaunted Bob negotiated rent on a factory at 43 Sydenham Road, Brookvale NSW and commenced installation of the plant. Whilst installing the plant word had got around that a new anodiser was about to commence operations and number of people got in contact with Bob, some were customers, some were people that became employees and the anodising plant came into operation. Today such a decision would be considered foolhardy but not in these times and by sheer will and hardwork Bob had an anodising plant that was capable of giving him the quality bright finishes that he required for his Shower screen product.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website"},
