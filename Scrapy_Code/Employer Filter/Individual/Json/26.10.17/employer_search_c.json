Occasionally, we invite international and local artists to present exhibitions, cultural events and contemporary art shows in the space.\n\nThe Museum offers a variety of guided tours, programs and workshops that are available for group bookings.\nHistory of the Museum\n\nThe Museum of Chinese Australian History was established in 1985 as a community-run, not-for-profit national institution to document, preserve, collect and research the history and culture of Chinese Australians and their descendants.\n\nThe Museum is housed in a late nineteenth century five-level warehouse. The warehouse was built in 1890 by the Cohen Bros who were furniture manufacturers and they used this building as a factory to make furniture and also a storeroom.\n\nAfter the Cohen Bros moved out, it was purchased by Her Majesty\u2019s theatre and was used for the storage of sets and costumes. During the hey-day of musical extravaganzas, it was also used as change rooms for the large choruses that were a part of these shows.\n\nThe building was acquired by the Victorian government from Her Majesty\u2019s in 1985 and is rented by the Museum for a nominal fee. When it opened its doors to the public in November 1985 it had no foundation collection and only three levels of the building had been renovated \u2013 basement, ground and first floors. The second floor was renovated in 1987 and the third floor along with the rest of the building in 1995. In 2010 renovations were made to the ground and first floors\nOn 19 March 2013 the Members of the Museum of Chinese Australian History voted at a Special General Meeting for the Museum to work towards moving from being an Incorporated Association to being a Company Limited by Guarantee.  This was principally due to the Museum endeavouring to build a national focus and wishing to work under a legal structure that supports activities across Australia.  The Museum will remain a community-based organisation.  The Museum will ensure that it retains its charitable status and DGR status.  The Museum will remain a not-for-profit organisation.  The Museum has engaged a legal firm to see us through this process.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

His vision led to the creation of the service operation Classic Caravan Repair Centre in Melbourne, Australia. Working closely with caravan manufacturers, caravan dealers, hirers and leading caravan insurance companies of that period this exclusive business grew rapidly.\n\nBecause of the success of Classic as a retail and repair operation, it was then deemed expedient to structure and launch a separate wholesale business.\nIn 1972, Camec was born. Camec is an acronym for Caravan And Marine Equipment Company.\n\nCamec expanded its operations during the late 1980s through the purchase of an aluminium roll forming plant, the purchase of tooling for caravan water tank production and the introduction of innovative and alternative products from overseas suppliers for the local market.\n\nIn 1991 Camec acquired its main competitor at the time \u2013 Caraparts. This acquisition added to Camec\u2019s portfolio an RV window, door and hatch manufacturing plant and a Queensland based sales and distribution facility which expanded Camec to a national based operation.\n\nContinued research and development saw Camec introduce new products to the RV range including the Galaxy window, the Camec security door, and the 4-seasons skylight roof hatch, along with greater colour options and far more diverse size alternatives. In 2004 Camec developed and released the new slimline range of RV wind-out windows.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

He and his family fled communist Hungary, with little more than his clothes. \n\nAfter a year in a Red Cross Refugee Camp in Austria and a long wait in England, their application for refugee status to Australia was finally accepted. \n\nThe family was thrilled to be making a fresh start in a new country after the hardships that they endured throughout the revolution and war. \n\n\nThe Story \n\n\nArriving in Australia, the family reunited in Adelaide after being separated during the immigration process. Vili attended the local public school in his area, St Joseph\u2019s Primary where he struggled to master the English language, excelled at maths and loved playing soccer.\n\nAt 14 years of age, he was sent out to work, to bring money into the family. He completed his apprenticeship at a local continental bakery. Once qualified at 18 years, Vili commenced his own business, leasing equipment and employing his fianc\u00e9e and mother part-time. It was a high quality continental cake bakery, with emphasis on high quality using premium ingredients. With $50 capital, and by selling his car for the first week\u2019s stock, Vili\u2019s dream of owning his business began. He started this business on the 6th Jan 1968 aged 19, just ten years to the day after arriving in Australia.\n\nLater, at the request of his sister who sold his products, he decided to make pies, pasties and sausage rolls for her to sell in her snack bar, rather than have her purchase them from elsewhere. He re-fashioned the traditional Aussie pie and pasty to make it acceptable to people from all backgrounds. This was not immediately successful. It took some time to educate consumers away from the traditional 'aussie' products. Drawing on his background of continental pastry training he transformed the crust to a light flaky pastry. He uses only 100% Australian beef in his pies, and requests only choice cuts of meat.\n\nIt took until 1990 for Vili\u2019s to expand from the original homemade bakery to the modern export facility we have today. However, some aspects will never change. Our products are still hand made, using the freshest ingredients, including vegetables grown especially for Vili\u2019s. Although continental cakes and yeast products are still a key part of our business the pies have taken place as our premium-selling product through innovation of new flavours, drawn from Europe, Asia and our Aboriginal Bush Tucker.\n\n\u201cDaring to be different\u201d has set us apart from the rest.\n\nVili trains his own staff and is a \u201chands-on\u201d type of employer who works alongside his workers - It is not a business that can be run from an office. He encourages pride in the business and the employees are proud to be a part of a successful team.\n\nVili\u2019s is known in the market place for being a sought-after product of high quality, a standard which Vili has always striven for, since commencing the business in 1968. Vili and his wife Rosemary are proud to have taken the business from strength to strength. Their son, Simon and daughter Alison are actively involved in the management, with Simon being in International Sales, and Alison as State Manager of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nVili\u2019s Pies are now enjoyed nationally and internationally, in Asia, Europe, the Pacific and in the U.S.A.\n\nThrough innovation, quality products and customer service we believe you will always\n\n                 \u201cTaste the Difference\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},
