The ISAS Trust has since expanded to offer vision, long-term disability and life insurance plans.\n\nThe ISAS Trust is a tax-exempt, 501(c)(9) Voluntary Employees\u2019 Beneficiary Association (VEBA) governed by ERISA law. The ISAS Trust is also registered as a Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement (MEWA) in the state of Oklahoma.  The ISAS Trust is audited annually by an independent accounting firm and receives an annual opinion from a registered actuary regarding its financial condition.\n\nThe ISAS Trust has 22 members as of September 1, 2013, and covers more than 2,700 employees and 4,400 total individuals. Each member school is represented by a Trustee, and the Board of Trustees governs the activities of the ISAS Trust. A third-party administrator (TPA) provides claims administration and assistance with enrollment and billing. Excess reinsurance (stop-loss coverage) provides protection to the ISAS Trust if claims of any individual exceed a specified limit. For the medical plan, the ISAS Trust requires that member schools make a minimum three-year commitment and meet specific minimum participation requirements.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

In 2016, Inverell was named one of the fastest growing inland communities in NSW. Due to its location, Inverell is a commercial hub which services an estimated 60 000 people, with a catchment stretching as far as southern Queensland.   Founded originally as a small town to support agriculture, mainly grazing, the nearby discovery of tin then diamonds saw Inverell become the centre for mining tin, diamonds, lead and silver. The town grew rapidly to support the mining industry and workers flocked to the district with the hope of striking it rich.\n \n\n\nBy the 1950's, Inverell had become the largest producer of sapphires in the world, with mining companies large and small in search of the precious gemstones which had been known to exist for three quarters of a century. This led to Inverell becoming known as the Sapphire City. Nowadays, sapphire mining continues in the east of the shire. The collapse of the tin cartel in the 1980's saw tin mining cease throughout the region.\n\nIn 1979, three councils amalgamated to form what is now the Inverell Shire Council. With this progression, local government had undertaken a new approach in its role of not just being a provider of essential services but entered into the field of land purchase for residential and industrial use.\n\nCouncil proceeded to lay a new pipeline from Copeton Dam on the Gwydir River to secure long-term water supply for the Inverell community and a new water reticulation system for the township. A new sewerage treatment plant was subsequently constructed. Both facilities were designed with the future in mind and are able to service a population well above the present levels.\n\nThe Council's philosophy has always been to create employment for its citizens and support industry while utilising effectively any aid that be forthcoming from State and Federal Governments.\n\nInverell is situated on the Gwydir Highway, an east west highway linking the Newell and New England Highways. Travel time by road to Brisbane is just under five hours, with travel to Sydney close to seven hours. Inverell is currently serviced by NSW TrainLink and other bus services. The NSW TrainLink service operates a daily rail coach to Tamworth to link with the Sydney bound train service. A NSW TrainLink rail coach also connects to Grafton every second day.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

This initial service provided the local community with a doctor one day a week, through an arrangement with Redfern Aboriginal Medical Service.\n\nIn June 1984 the IAMS was incorporated, and with this came the first success in obtaining funding grants.  The Service moved to a small house in Church Street, Wollongong, and despite a few set backs and financial challenges, by June 1986 it was able to purchase essential equipment, and employ a receptionist, an administrator, and a doctor five days a week. \n\nIn 1987 the IAMS gained financial assistance from NSW Health Department, and with the assistance of further grants, was able to supply a dental service two days a week, as well as employ a Drug and Alcohol Worker, Public Health Worker, and Assistant.\n\nThis expansion meant the Service was fast outgrowing its premises.  Numerous applications for funding to purchase new premises were submitted, with no success, until 1994, when a grant was finally obtained from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.  This grant enabled the purchase of the block of land next door to the Church Street premises, and the construction of a new, purpose-built facility, at the cost of $1.8 million.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},
