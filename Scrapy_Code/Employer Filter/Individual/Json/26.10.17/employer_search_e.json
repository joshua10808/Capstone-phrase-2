{"employer_url": "https://www.seek.com.au/companies/ensign-services-438188", "employer_name": "Ensign Services", "employer_info": "Our organization was formed in 1999 with the goal of establishing a new level of quality care within the skilled nursing industry. The name \"Ensign\" is synonymous with a \"flag\" or a \"standard,\" and refers to our goal of setting the standard by which all others are measured. We believe that through our efforts and leadership, we can set a new standard in the long-term care industry.\n\nA lot has changed since 1999. Expansion occurred due to strategy of acquiring under-performing skilled nursing facilities and then transforming them into market leaders in clinical quality, staff competency, employee loyalty and financial performance.\n\nToday, subsidiaries of The Ensign Group now provide\n\u2022Skilled nursing and rehabilitative care services through the operation of over 100 skilled nursing facilities located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.\n\u2022Home health and hospice services through the operation of agencies located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington.\n\u2022Urgent health care in the Seattle, Washington area. Walk-in clinics offer daily access to immediate treatment for minor injuries and illnesses, including x-ray and lab services, all from convenient neighborhood locations with no appointments.\n\u2022Mobile diagnostic services, including digital x-ray, ultrasound, electrocardiograms, ankle-brachial index, and phlebotomy services to people in their homes or at long-term care facilities.\n\nStructure\n\nOur organizational structure is what some call \"bottom-up\", but we prefer to call it \"flat.\" Decision making lies with local leadership, not corporate offices. This means that leaders and staff are generally free to discern and address the unique needs and priorities of health care professionals, customers and other stakeholders in the local community or market, and then work to create a superior service offering and reputation for that particular community or market. We believe our success is largely dependent upon the ability of these local leaders to build and maintain strong relationships with key stakeholders from the local community, based upon a solid foundation of reliably superior care.\n\nEach of our operations is led by highly dedicated individuals who are responsible for key operational decisions. Leaders and staff are trained and motivated to pursue superior clinical outcomes, high patient and family satisfaction, operating efficiencies and financial performance at their operations. It is solely through their dedication that an operation becomes the \"provider of choice\" in its community.\n\nAnother unique facet of our organizational structure is the cluster model. Market leaders share real-time operating data and otherwise benchmark clinical and operational performance with their peers in order to improve clinical care, maximize patient satisfaction and augment operational efficiencies. These clusters share best practices, challenge one another and hold each other accountable to their operational commitments.\n\nLocal operations are organized into portfolio companies. Each portfolio company has its own president who is an experienced and proven leader typically selected from the ranks of field CEOs. Our presidents serve as an operational resource to local leaders within their own portfolio company. They have primary responsibility for recruiting qualified talent, finding potential acquisition targets, and identifying other internal and external growth opportunities. Our presidents typically have a clinical partner dedicated to operational clinical quality and success. The portfolio companies also provide subject matter experts in areas such as clinical, therapy, MDS and accounting for operations that need additional help in these areas.\n\nWe do not maintain a corporate headquarters; rather, we operate a Service Center which exists solely to serve and support the efforts of each operation. Our Service Center is comprised of a dedicated team of professionals that provide centralized accounting, construction, compliance, human resources, health information management, information technology, legal, payroll, risk management and other key services, so that local leaders can focus on delivering quality care, maintaining employee satisfaction and running an efficient operation. This approach allows each operation to function with the strength and synergies of a large organizations, but without the disadvantages of a top-down corporate hierarchy.

Emirates airline will play a big role in supporting this goal, and so will dnata, our home-grown air services provider which has transformed from modest beginnings into a global player.\n\nToday, Emirates airline connects over 145 cities to Dubai and to each other, facilitating trade and tourism flows across six continents; while dnata provides ground handling, catering, cargo and travel services not only in Dubai, but across 90 cities, in 38 countries on five continents. \n\nDubai is investing in infrastructure to meet the city\u2019s future growth, and so is the Emirates Group. By 2020, Emirates expects to carry 70 million passengers per year on over 300 aircraft, and we are developing our workforce, and building cutting-edge facilities to support operations of this scale. We will also continue to strengthen our global footprint, so that we can serve and connect even more cities across the world.\n\nFor us, growth is not only about the numbers. We are here for the long haul, and we are conscious that with the scale of what we do, we can make a difference to economies, communities, and the environment. We consciously strive to improve our economic, environmental and social impact in a meaningful way.\n\nIn this regard, one of our key focus areas has always been the management of resource consumption. Reducing unnecessary consumption not only reduces environmental impact, but also has a direct benefit on our bottom line. Fuel efficiency is, as always, central to our business.\n\nEmirates already operates one of the youngest and most efficient aircraft fleets in the sky. In the past year, we received 24 new passenger and freighter aircraft comprising Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s. Representing the very latest in commercial aircraft technology, these new aircraft continue to help us improve the overall fuel efficiency and noise profile of our fleet.\n\nIn November 2013, we made a massive investment in the latest, most environmentally efficient aircraft technology with an order for 150 next-generation Boeing 777Xs. When delivered from 2020 onwards, these 777Xs will help us to achieve the next level in fuel efficiency.\n\nAt Emirates, we have an ongoing focus to operate our aircraft in the most efficient, responsible way possible. In addition to our own operational efficiency efforts, our partnerships with air navigation service providers have also been key to implementing fuel- and time-saving routes.\n\nOn the ground, Group companies and business units work to recycle various materials, minimise water and paper consumption, and operate ground vehicles more efficiently. For example, dnata\u2019s Airport Operations teams minimise water use when washing aircraft, and recycle newspapers and other paper products collected from Emirates aircraft cabins at Dubai International Airport.\n\nWe have also continued our tradition of supporting biodiversity and conservation. One thousand endangered houbara bustards, a culturally important bird species for the UAE, were released in the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, the management of which is supported by Emirates.\n\nThese birds have thrived and some have successfully reared chicks. Our conservation based resort in Australia\u2019s Blue Mountains, Emirates Wolgan Valley Resort and Spa, continued to win awards for sustainability, as well as play host to rare and endangered wildlife.\n\nThese are just some highlights of our efforts of the past year, and as you read the rest of this report, I hope you will be as heartened as I am to see the progress that we have made in improving our environmental and other sustainability metrics.\n\nWe know that every little effort counts.. Just as we know that to make a truly meaningful impact, sustainability efforts have to be continuous and long-term. Source: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},
