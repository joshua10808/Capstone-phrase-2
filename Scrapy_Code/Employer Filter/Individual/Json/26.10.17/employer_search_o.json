The company emerged from a need to improve the health of Indigenous people in remote Australia by addressing nutrition-related health problems, unreliable food supplies, stores closing because of poor management and build-up of debt.\n\nOnce the stores are commercially self-sufficient, the store owners work with the store committee to decide how to spend the profits for the benefit of the community, in line with the rules of individual Store Corporations.\n\n\nThe first official Outback Stores\u2019 managed store opened at Canteen Creek in May 2007 and in June 2007 the Federal Government introduced its Northern Territory Emergency Response Bill to Parliament. As part of the intervention, Outback Stores was funded to support stores that were badly needed in communities but were facing closure due to poor management and build-up of debt. \n\nThe funding ensured these remote stores remained open to provide food security, keep local jobs and, if needed, upgrade the store\u2019s infrastructure.  In 2009, Outback Stores was funded to support remote stores outside of the Northern Territory. The company now manages stores across the Northern Territory as well as in Western Australia and South Australia.\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website"},

Teachers prepared sets of lessons posted fortnightly to remote students. Mothers and governesses worked with children to complete lessons that were then returned to Adelaide. Questions from students and mothers were also posted to Adelaide. Snail mail, often taking 2-6 weeks, did little to alleviate feelings of isolation.\n\nIn 1958, SA School of the Air was established with support from the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Using two-way radios, students on remote properties became connected with peers and their teachers.\n\nToday, advanced technology is used to synchronously connect teachers and students. Students can see and talk to classmates and teachers, work collaboratively and receive immediate feedback. Asynchronous support is provided through email and subject/year level websites.\n\nThe mainstay of education for remote and isolated families, students enrol for a variety of reasons including health, travel, elite sport, work commitments, and incarceration.
