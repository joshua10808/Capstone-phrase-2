Having a trade background, I was passionate about the materials I used and attention to detail in my craft. I wanted this philosophy to underpin everything we do at Urbanedge.\n\nThat\u2019s why every home we create is expertly designed, drawing on the latest styles and techniques, yet keeping long-term appeal foremost in our minds. It\u2019s why every home we build uses superior products and materials to above industry standards \u2013 homes admired as much for their stunning aesthetic as for their exceptional value and the calibre of their craftsmanship.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},
