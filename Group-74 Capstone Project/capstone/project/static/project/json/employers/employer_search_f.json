It sits in all capital cities and elsewhere in Australia from time to time.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe objectives of the Court are to:\n\nDecide disputes according to law - promptly, courteously and effectively and, in so doing, to interpret the statutory law and develop the general law of the Commonwealth, so as to fulfil \nthe role of a court exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth under the Constitution.\nProvide an effective registry service to the community.\nManage the resources allotted by Parliament efficiently.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

{"employer_url": "https://www.seek.com.au/companies/federal-circuit-court-795385", "employer_name": "Federal Circuit Court", "employer_info": "Objectives\n\nThe Court was established to provide a simple and accessible alternative to litigation in the Federal Court of Australia (Federal Court) and the Family Court of Australia (Family Court) and to relieve the workload of those courts. The FCC Act directs the Court to operate informally and to use streamlined procedures. This complements the Parliament\u2019s initiatives to encourage people to engage in a range of dispute resolution processes.\n\nThe Court is committed to providing access to justice to the people of Australia. The Court\u2019s expansive regional circuit network is demonstrative of this commitment. Judges regularly travel to various regional locations to hear matters, alleviating the burden on regional litigants (and their legal representatives) to travel to major cities to have their matters dealt with. The Federal Circuit Court is the only federal court that regularly conducts regional circuits. The Court\u2019s commitment to the provision of access to justice for all Australians is further illustrated by its ability to conduct special sittings in most regions of Australia on demand.\n\nThe Court also has a continuing commitment to finalise matters promptly and efficiently. During 2007\u201308, 85.9 per cent of matters were finalised within six months and 95.8 per cent of family law matters filed in the Court were finalised within 12 months. In the general federal law jurisdiction, 73.1 per cent finalised within six months and 91.1 per cent were finalised within 12 months.\n\nJurisdiction\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit Court has grown since its inception and broadly includes family law and child support, administrative law, admiralty law, bankruptcy, copyright, human rights, industrial law, migration, privacy and trade practices. The court shares those jurisdictions with the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia. Some work in those jurisdictions continues to be done in state and territory courts also.\n\nSince its establishment, the range and volume of cases heard by the court has substantially increased, confirming the Court\u2019s role in Australia's federal judicial system. The Court deals with approximately 95% of migration and bankruptcy applications filed in the federal courts. Approximately 90% of the court's workload is in the area of family law. Five years ago, the Court dealt with 40% of all family law matters filed in the federal courts (excluding Western Australian family law matters). This has increased to nearly 80%.\n\nDivisions\n\nThe Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009 included miscellaneous amendments to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999 to establish two divisions within the Federal Circuit Court, a Fair Work division and a general division. As from 1 July 2009 proceedings in the Court must be instituted, heard and determined in one of these divisions.\n\nThe Fair Work Act Fair Work (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Act 2009 and the Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Act 2009 respectively provide similarly in respect of matters arising under the continuing operation of the pre-July 2009 Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. The general division will hear and determine all matters which are not required to be exercised in the Fair Work division.\n\nAdministration of the Court\n\nThe Corporate Services Branch of the Federal Court of Australia's Principal Registry provides administration and support to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. The Branch consists of six sections: Information Technology, Human Resources, Finance, Contracts, Communications, and Property and Facilities. Catherine Sullivan is the Executive Director Corporate Services.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

Unfortunately, this request was met with great resistance.\n\nMrs. Johnson and her late husband John H. Johnson, publisher of Ebony and Jet magazine, went to a private lab that developed formulas out of the mixtures the models created. After successfully applying this makeup on the models in the fashion show, the Johnsons produced The Capsule Collection, a mail-order package in 1969.
