From this standpoint only rational design decisions can flow \u2013 with consequent robustness, \u2018buildability\u2019 and economy. And we believe that a building should be fun, friendly and forever adaptable.\n\nWe are committed to the notion of environmentally sustainable, responsible architecture. Which leads to a whole-of-site approach (and beyond).\nBuilding is a verb, too: we enjoy thinking bout the (human) process of building\ndeveloping building programs that incorporate local materials and trade-skills, artist and community resources: an event that might add to a community\u2019s social and cultural fabric.\n\ntroppo architects: 34 years and on...\n\nOur story began with the publication of \u2018Influences in Regional Architecture\u2019 in 1978 \u2013 Australia\u2019s first history of architecture outside the urban arena. The registered practice commenced in Darwin in 1980 with the aid of an NT Government history grant to research (and eventually define and publicise) the History of Tropical Housing in Australia\u2019s Top End.\n\nThis knowledge has in turn enabled us to create a new and relevant contemporary architecture for the local climate and cultural setting: a contemporary architecture with a traditional base. In the meantime this regionally responsive approach has also been applied to projects in the Kimberley, Perth, Esperance, and inland WA; Adelaide, coastal, rural and far-northern SA; Melbourne and Victoria; Alice Springs and the Centre; Townsville, throughout Queensland, in Sydney and up the NSW coast.

{"employer_url": "https://www.seek.com.au/companies/trinity-catholic-college-802125", "employer_name": "Trinity Catholic College", "employer_info": "On 2nd January 1817, Marcellin Champagnat welcomed two young men into a house which he had rented in the town of La Valla where he was the assistant pastor. Their names were Jean-Baptiste Audras and Jean-Marie Granjon. They became the first Marist Brothers and the date became known as the Foundation Day. Later that year these two Brothers began to teach the young people of La Valla, thus beginning the first Marist school.\n\nIn 2017, we celebrate the beginning of the third century of Marist Education. It is incredible to think that our way of educating young people in Australia traces its origins to the work St Marcellin and his Brothers began in rural France two hundred years ago! Theirs was a different time, a different context and as they began their work, the Australian colony that was just beginning, it was, in fact, struggling to survive.\n\nAs \u2018modern day Marists\u2019 we ask ourselves, what is this Marist way that we continue to draw inspiration from? What is still relevant in Twenty-First Century Australia? While the Bicentenary year will provide us with a chance to reflect on this more deeply, I would suggest some characteristics that we know remain. They are:\n\nWe value and encourage hard work;\n\n\u25feWe design and approach learning and teaching with simplicity;\n\u25feWe are a family of schools, not simply another institution; and\n\u25feWe know our presence with, to and for each other is how we learn and how we are formed as human beings.\n\nOur Marist way is the way of Mary . The way of Mary is a way of gentleness, strength, and closeness to Jesus. Mary\u2019s way is also one of total \u2018openness to God\u2019. Mary\u2019s way is to say \u2018Yes\u2019 to all that life brings. At times a resounding, faith-filled \u2018yes\u2019, at others a tentative \u2018yes\u2019 that is a step into the unknown.\n\nLiving in the way of Mary, we can and do bring Jesus to our world, knowing that it is in God that \u2018we live and move and have our being.\u2019\nGenuinely Catholic and Proudly Marist\n\nTrinity Catholic College takes its name from the heart of our Catholic faith, affirming our belief in God as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\nOur crest and motto celebrate our belief in the risen Jesus whose presence we encounter and celebrate in our Australian context.  We proudly embrace the spirit of Saint Marcellin Champagnat as a Marist school, and provide a Catholic education \u2018in the way of Mary\u2019.\nExcellence in Learning and Teaching\n\nOur vision that students are safe, happy, well taught and learn to know and love Jesus underpins our rich and varied curriculum.  Beginning in Year 7, all students experience learning in a calm, well-ordered, safe and happy community.  An emphasis on each student\u2019s achievement of excellence through hard work, affirmation and personal challenge, and the building of strong relationships with our dedicated, passionate teachers, have led to Trinity\u2019s outstanding success.\n\nThese successes include:\n\u25fe81% of HSC Courses above state average \u2013 2015.\n\u25feWe celebrate our ongoing and proven success as one of Sydney\u2019s highest performing Systemic Catholic schools.\n\u25feOn average, 86% of all HSC courses for the last five years above state average.\n\u25fe87% of our students gained university entry \u2013 2015.\n\nIn 2015 our results were once again outstanding with:\n\u25fe81% of HSC courses above state average;\n\u25fe73 Band 6\u2019s and E4\u2019s;\n\u25fe333 Band 5\u2019s and E3\u2019s\n\nOur results speak for themselves!\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

Identifying a gap in the market for funky, artisanal ice cream or Italian gelato, the idea to create a contemporary, fun brand with surprisingly different products and flavours was developed.\n\nThe first Trampoline store opened in April 2004 on Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, a diverse food and cafe precinct bordering Melbourne's CBD with an eclectic mix of all things trendy and cool.\n\nOver the next 9 years the business grew \u2026 and grew \u2026 and grew.\n\nIn October 2013, the Trampoline brand was acquired by Franchised Food Company, a market leader in fun treats.\n\n100% Australian owned, Franchised Food Company is a specialist in retail franchising and Australia's largest multi-system, non-listed franchisor.  \nGelato is Italian for Ice Cream and the basic ingredients are the same: Milk, Cream and sugar.

{"employer_url": "https://www.seek.com.au/companies/tradetools-834700", "employer_name": "TradeTools", "employer_info": "We are still a private organisation that includes 2 companies; TradeTools Pty Ltd & TradeTools Regional Pty Ltd. TradeTools Regional Pty Ltd is our second company created some years ago to primarily reward sales staff that had served at TradeTools for a full 10 years or more. These people have been granted full shares in 'Regional'; which now totally owns some of the TradeTools stores that you may visit. So, don't be surprised if you are served by a shareholder of which there are now over 35 of us throughout TradeTools! This ethos is probably one important reason why you see so many long serving familiar faces throughout all of our TradeTools stores, something that we are justly proud of &, we are told, a major indicator of a properly run, prosperous & very solid business.\nInside TradeTools Store \nWe have the broad philosophy of always attempting to be the best industrial tool company anywhere in Australia! We have always realised that this aim comprises many important elements including a genuine respect for customers, suppliers & staff in equal measure. We build upon this by attempting to offer the deepest collection of industrial tool products available anywhere, at prices that make our competition all but irrelevant! The bulk of our profits have always been reinvested back into our business to the extent that we have never used any loan or overdraft facilities of any sort, plus we own outright most of our store buildings & infrastructure. This very hard won low overhead structure reflects back in us being able to attract, afford & keep the best professional staff in our field whilst still staying famously competitive & innovative. We are the absolute opposite of too many modern companies that have a top heavy & expensive overhead structure lording over an underpaid staff base where poor service & rich pricing seems, all too often, to be the accepted norm!\nAt TradeTools, we are often asked as to whether or not we offer franchises? The answer to this is simply that we do not. We have never believed that franchising ever works for long in the tool industry and we have watched throughout the years as it has been tried and repeatedly failed. We are an industry that, on the one hand, enjoys a relatively high turnover but, historically, survives on extremely thin margins. This is a mix that never really suits franchising as the cost base of running a franchised operation, in the tool industry, is way too high for it to remain viable and healthily competitive for long. From a competitive standpoint, none of us here could ever see how any franchised competitor could ever genuinely compete with a company such as the likes of TradeTools on an ongoing basis. Quite simply the figures just don\u2019t stack up unless, of course, a franchised competitor was prepared to continually take to market competing products at prices considerably above those that we charge. Of course, the other alternative would be to offer inferior products to ours at similar prices but, in this particular industry, neither scenario seems viable or sustainable to us.\nRenegade Industrial Compressors \nYou will see many products at TradeTools that are totally unavailable through any other company. In some cases we have helped develop these products from scratch, in fact we manufacture in Queensland many of our air compressors under the now famous Renegade Industrial brand. We also directly import hundreds of containers each year comprising all forms of machinery, industrial power tools & hand tools plus a huge range of accessories & consumables. TradeTools are also the warranty agents for everything that we sell so, in most cases, we can decide & act within a very short space of time should you ever have a problem with anything sourced from us. We absolutely believe in genuine, ethical, old fashioned service combined with proper in depth knowledge covering the full breadth of our range. And there is no other tool company anywhere that offers anything like the massive range of tool products in which we proudly specialise, in fact it is quite accurate to state that we are unaware of any other company quite like TradeTools anywhere else in Australia!\n\nMy family have been in the tool industry since 1948. My father created the tool company Glenfords which we sold out of many years ago & some of the original staff members from that early company are now working shareholders within TradeTools. Most importantly, all of us here at TradeTools never fail to greatly value your custom & we hope to be able to continue to serve you for still many more years into the future.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

What was amazing? Many people who had discomfort when drinking ordinary cows\u2019 milk were able to enjoy a2 Milk\u2122 without the same downsides because it contains only the A2 protein and no A1.\n\nHe further discovered that, originally, all cows produced only the A2 protein and no A1 (the A1 protein emerged later through modern farming practises in European herds and then spread throughout the world).\n\nCorrie knew there were still some cows that produced milk with only the A2 protein. The secret was finding a safe and non-invasive way to identify the right cows and ensure he could deliver natural and pure a2 Milk\u2122, completely free from the A1 protein, to people everywhere. So, he did.\n\nAnd, from there, The a2 Milk Company\u2122 was formed.\n\nToday, our mission remains the same: to pioneer the scientific understanding behind a2 Milk\u2122 so we can bring more people the pleasure and nutritional goodness that only comes from real and natural milk.\n\nThe a2 Milk Company\u2122 has trading activities in Australia, New Zealand, UK, the US and China.\n\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},

Wine merchants in Sydney, all three Taylors were singularly passionate about wine \u2013 and most particularly the famous French clarets such as Chateau Mouton Rothschild from Bordeaux. This love affair with exceptionally crafted wine eventually inspired them to try and create a stunning wine of their own\u2026\n\nRed, brown, and gold\n\nBill Snr, Bill and John set out to find the perfect piece of land to establish a vineyard in the Taylors name. In 1969, after a considerable search, they found a promising 178-hectare site by the Wakefield River in the Clare Valley. They were certain the soil \u2013 red brown loam over limestone (now called terra rossa) \u2013 would prove conducive to crafting wines of the highest quality. The contrast of warm days and cool nights in the Clare would be equally beneficial \u2013 helping the Cabernet Sauvignon grapes ripen in the day, and rest at night.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for this bold vision to be realised \u2013 and critical recognition soon followed. In fact, when they entered their first ever vintage release in the Royal Adelaide Wine Show, it took home the coveted Montgomery Trophy for best red wine in show. The accolades didn\u2019t stop there however \u2013 that 1973 vintage won a gold medal at every national wine show it was entered in.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},
