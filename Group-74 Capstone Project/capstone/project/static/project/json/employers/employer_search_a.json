We see the scientific method as a multi-step process that includes designing the right experiment, collecting and analyzing data and rational decision making. It is not subjective or emotional, but rather a logical, open and rational process. Applying the scientific method in all parts of the organisation is expected and highly valued. \n\nCompete Intensely and Win\n\nWe compete against time, past performance and industry rivals to rapidly achieve high quality results. Winning requires taking risks. We cannot be lulled into complacency by previous achievements. Though we compete intensely, we maintain high ethical standards and demand integrity in our dealings with competitors, customers, partners and each other. \n\nCreate Value for Patients, Staff and Stockholders\n\nWe provide value by focusing on the needs of patients. Amgen creates a work environment that provides opportunities for staff members to reach their full potential. We strive to provide stockholders with superior long-term returns while balancing the needs of patients, staff and stockholders. \n\nBe Ethical\n\nWe are relentless in applying the highest ethical standards to our products, services and communications. \n\nTrust and Respect Each Other\n\nEvery job at Amgen is important and every Amgen staff member is important. We attract diverse, capable and committed people and provide an environment that fosters inclusion, respect, individual responsibility and values diversity. Trust is strengthened through personal initiative and by obtaining quality results rapidly. \n\nEnsure Quality\n\nQuality is a cornerstone of all of our activities. We seek the highest quality information, decisions and people. We produce high quality products and services. Quality is woven into the fabric of everything we do. \n\nWork in Teams\n\nOur teams work quickly to move scientific breakthroughs from the lab through the clinic to the marketplace and to support other aspects of our business. Diverse teams working together generate the best decisions for patients, staff and stockholders. Our team structure provides opportunities for Amgen staff to impact the direction of the organisation, to gain broader perspective about other functions within Amgen and to reach their full potential. \n\nCollaborate, Communicate and Be Accountable\n\nLeaders at Amgen seek input and involve key stakeholders in important decisions. In gathering input, strong leaders will welcome diverse opinions, conflicting views and open dialogue for serious consideration. They will clearly communicate decisions and rationale openly and in a timely manner. Once a decision is made, the leader and members of the team will all be accountable for the results and for implementing the decision rapidly.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},
