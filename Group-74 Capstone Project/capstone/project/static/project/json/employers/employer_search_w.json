The Hobart casino has ties dating back to the dawn of Australia\u2019s hotel industry with this family-owned company representing the country\u2019s oldest continually operating hotel group. \n\nOwned by the Federal Group, the Wrest Point story begins in the 1800s when a group of businessmen decided to form the Federal Coffee Palace Company. At the time, this palace was the tallest building in Melbourne. Renamed the Hotel Federal in 1924, it became the cornerstone of what is now the Federal Group. \n\nOver five decades the Group busied themselves operating some of the country\u2019s finest hotels including Savoy Plaza and The Windsor, before turning their attention to Tasmania, purchasing Wrest Point Riviera Hotel in Sandy Bay. In doing so, Federal Group became part of Tasmanian history and the birth of Australia\u2019s first casino unfolded. \n\nShortly after European settlement, an inn was built on the current Wrest Point site by William Chaffey in 1839. It was later purchased by Arthur Drysdale who created Tasmania\u2019s prestigious international hotel, the Wrest Point Riviera. A much loved institution, the Riviera became a centre for the community, renowned for its dances and entertainment, much like the Wrest Point of today. \n\nWhen Greg Farrell senior (former Federal Group chairman) honeymooned with his wife Dolores at Wrest Point, the connection was instant with his Hobart accommodation. Greg believed it was \u201cthe greatest hotel site in the world- right on the shore of the beautiful Derwent Estuary with the backdrop of Mount Wellington.\u201d This love of place would be passed through three generations of the Farrell family. \n\nAs chairman, Greg Farrell senior was the driving force behind the Wrest Point Casino development. But he couldn\u2019t do it without the support of the Tasmanian people who not only voted for the development but became part of the brand and Wrest Point story. This Hobart entertainment venue marked a new era for Tasmania and for its people. \n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

He was the first to settle the present day site.\n\nIt was then that Allen, who was the Postmaster, changed the settlement's name to Winton. He decided the former names were too difficult to write on the postage stamps. So he named the town after a suburb in Bournemouth, England, in which he was born.\n\nOn the 5th of July 1879, Winton was gazetted as a town by the Government, along with two areas, each 640 acres, that were retained for Town Common purposes.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},
