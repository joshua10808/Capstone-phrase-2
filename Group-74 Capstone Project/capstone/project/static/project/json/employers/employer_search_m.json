The area is serviced by 18 harvesting contractors cutting an average of 55,000 tonnes and transported by a cane railway network extending over 256 kilometres.\n\n\n\nThe Mulgrave district was the first to adopt green cane harvesting in 1983 which increased rapidly to over 90% by 1990. All cane is now harvested green leaving a trash blanket which acts as a weed suppressant and assists with moisture retention.\n\nThe area has a range of soil types which influence growing practices and cane variety selection. The crop is rain fed with an average rainfall of 1800-2000 mm per year.\n\nMulgrave Mill was the first mill to take advantage of industry deregulation in 2006 when the company directly marketed its own sugar and commenced developing strong customer relations in the Asia Pacific Region. Raw Sugar produced at Mulgrave Mill is exported through the bulk sugar terminal at Cairns, one of Queensland's many purpose built storage terminals for raw sugar exports.\n\n\n\nPart of the Mill's operations includes the maintenance of its 256 kilometre cane railway system, which allows for cane to be hauled with no impact on local roads.\n\nMulgrave Mill generates all of the power required by the factory for operation during the crushing season in addition to exporting electricity to the State grid\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website"},

Following an active acquisition and organic growth strategy, Metso soon became one of the world's leading process industry suppliers.\n\nThe year of 2013 marked a special turning point in Metso's history when the decision was made to split the company into two listed, independent entities: Metso Corporation and Valmet Corporation. The latter continues the history of Valmet by serving industries that use bio-based raw materials. Metso focused on intelligent solutions and services for the mining, construction, and oil and gas industries.

Developed by Maria Montessori, the system is based on a deep understanding of child development from birth to adulthood.\n\nUnlike most schools, Montessori provides a consistent educational methodology which is applied throughout the toddler and school years. This leads to more self-reliant and motivated students better equipped for a positive life experience.\n\nMontessori education began in Australia over 100 years ago. Recent research and scientific opinion has supported the superior educational outcomes offered by Montessori Schools. Montessori better equips its student for our modern world of change and innovation. The founders of Google, Wikipedia and Amazon have Montessori educational backgrounds.\n\nMelbourne Montessori School (MMS) is an independent primary school for children from 3 to 12 years of age. There are two campuses, one in Caulfield and one in Brighton. Each has outdoor play space with interesting structures, and classrooms equipped with Montessori materials. These environments are prepared for children at each developmental level, and allow children to take responsibility for their own education. As a result our students develop a life-long passion for learning. \nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website"},

Our second ever customer was Nippon Meats, and over two decades we've continued to complete over 30 projects both big and small.

In some instances, machinery has been designed and built \u201cin house\u201d to ensure we exceed world standards of production, hygiene and sanitation.\n\nWe have become the biggest for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that the quality of our frozen foods is second to none and we are continually innovating to add to our product range.\n\nThe second reason is that our delivery and service is the best in Australia.\nMarathon enjoys a team-based approach to quality management where there is a high level of ownership of processes and product quality by our operators. Management of the manufacturing unit is based on the implementation of international Best Practice techniques.\nOur Licensing status ensures that we are able to facilitate distribution to all parts of the globe.\n\u2022BRC A grade certification incorporating HACCP\n\u2022EU licence for meat and dairy products\n\u2022Export licence to USA\n\u2022Export licence to ASIA, including Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines and Thailand.\n\u2022HALAL domestic and export licence\n\u2022AUS Meat accredited\n\n\nReduce\n\nMarathon Foods has been working hard to ensure the impact on our environment is minimised during the manufacturing process.

As a result of many years of continued drought in Australia, Marathon has looked at how we could support water conservation. We have worked with our staff to minimise water usage through more efficient cleaning methods.\n\n\nHere at Marathon Foods we believe in being involved in our local community, over the years Marathon Foods has sponsored many grass roots sporting teams, school fundraisers, etc, we are always happy to support where possible. Why not try Dim Sims on the BBQ for your next fundraiser along side the traditional snag and bread!\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year Marathon Foods implemented a process where 95% of product that previously went to landfill due  to rejection for being \u2018not perfect\u201d is now collected and distributed to not for profit organisations,  such as Foodbank.  Throughout the year we donate good, safe food to this great charity, assisting to support many Australian families in need.\nSince 1963 Marathon Foods has continued to source locally grown produce wherever possible. Throughout the years Marathon Foods has worked closely with Aussie Farmers thus building strong relationships to ensure continuity with both quality and supply throughout the year.\n\nOur goal is to continue to produce new and innovative quality products here in Australia utilising the best locally sourced produce available.\nSource: this is an extract from the company\u2019s own website."},
