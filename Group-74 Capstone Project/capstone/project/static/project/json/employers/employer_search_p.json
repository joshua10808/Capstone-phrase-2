He grew up with a family history in Real Estate, as the Blackshaw\u2019s were involved in property investment and development. In 1986 he sold a harbourside apartment on behalf of Sir Frank and Lady Renouf for a record $2.7 million. While working in Sydney he not only sold prime residential property, he diversified to include commercial sales involving shopping centre's and office complexes.\n\nIn 1988, wanting to spread his wings to a region which would be an excellent environment to raise his family while still living in a city,  he moved his family to Canberra and established his own Real Estate business in Manuka. He believed in the Canberra market and was sufficiently satisfied that it would warrant the kind of sales approach used in other major cities.\n\nPeter was a pioneering auctioneer whose marketing flair won him the distinction of successfully negotiating the first million dollar sale in Canberra. He also won the right to be the exclusive agent in marketing the Gleneagles development, the first of it\u2019s kind in Canberra.  This development consisted of more than 400 sites surrounded by an beautiful 18 hole golf course.\n\nPeter was and continues to believe in using auctions, especially if the market was strong, and his reputation saw him selling the majority of the quality properties within the Canberra market.

Parade College, in common with these schools, takes its inspiration from Br Edmund Rice, founder of the Christian Brothers. The values of the College are enshrined in the Charter for Edmund Rice Schools, and in the College Mission Statement.\n\nThe College programs and teaching approaches support and promote the principles and practice of Australian democracy, including a commitment to elected Government, the rule of law, equal rights for all before the law, freedom of religion, freedom of speech and association, and the values of openness and tolerance. \n\nThe College aims to help young men grow into well rounded individuals who will make a meaningful contribution to society. In a vibrant learning community, students are encouraged to explore and develop their talents to the fullest and aim for excellence in all endeavours.\nOur young men are challenged to achieve as highly as possible in their academic studies as they discern the appropriate pathway to their future ambitions. They are also encouraged through the various co-curricular offerings to grow into people of good heart who have healthy self-respect, who value right relationships with other people, and who can offer themselves in service to the needy and marginalised people in our society.\n\nWith long experience in responding to the particular educational needs of young men, the College offers many opportunities for growth through its sports programs, cultural activities, service to the community, retreats and liturgies, outdoor education etc. These in turn provide many leadership opportunities.\n\nThe pioneer Brothers commenced their education work in 1868 in the hall behind St Francis Church in the city while the site for a permanent school was found and a building constructed. In January 1871 students moved to the new site in Victoria Parade, East Melbourne and the College was officially established. In the 1960s the pressure of numbers gave rise to a search for a new site and in 1968 the College moved to its present expansive site in Bundoora. In 2009 the College embraced a second campus in Preston.  As a long-standing Catholic school for boys in the Edmund Rice tradition, Parade College will be a vibrant learning community offering best practice education and pastoral care to its members to foster fullness of life and holistic growth for all.  \nEDUCATION FOR BOYS \n\nWe\u2019re all well aware of the publicity about the problems boys face at schools, from poor attitudes to work and reluctance to communicate. As specialists in boys\u2019 education, we are experts in assisting boys to be proud of what they can achieve and who they are.\n\nThe keys to success are self-esteem, motivation and opportunities for success.
