NLV aims to provide a secure community where likeminded people, whose kids have left home, who can enjoy resort facilities in a park-like setting, without the mundane chores of normal suburban living that come with looking after a large (often older) home on a large block. We have created a place where people who are too fit, young, or healthy, for a traditional retirement village, can enjoy life. A virtual playground!\n\nAccording to the 3000 residents currently enjoying life in a National lifestyle Village, life is safer and less stressful, and living in an NLV village in Perth is a bit like being on holidays all year round. The most common regret that we hear amongst the community is, \"we should have made the move years ago\". \n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},

Cool Afro-Luso beats and friendly service add to the vibe, and then there\u2019s the piece-de- resistance \u2013 our flame-grilled PERi-PERi chicken that\u2019s served on beautiful crockery. \n\nIt makes for a sizzling experience and we can\u2019t wait for you to join our table.

Our Council has opted to use the 'undivided' method where residents and ratepayers in the LGA vote for any of the nominated candidates.\nThe other method is wards or the 'divided' method and in these cases each ward is represented by a number of Councillors who have been chosen by the electors of that ward. If a council wishes to change the number of council representatives or the method used to elect Councillors, it requires a constitutional referendum to be held.\n \nThe power delegated to Nambucca Shire Council and other councils throughout the State is derived from the Local Government Act 1993 and other Acts enacted by the parliament of NSW.\n \nA Councillor\u2019s responsibility is to make decisions on all areas of policy and budget priorities, including the level and extent of services and works to be provided during the year.\n \nDecisions are determined using the majority voting system in which each Councillor has one vote. If there are an equal number of votes, the Mayor has the casting vote.\n\nSource: This is an extract from the company's own website."},
