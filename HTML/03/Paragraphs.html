You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed:

<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser 
ignores it.

<!-- HTML Line Breaks -->

<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks</p>     <!-- The HTML <br> element defines a line break. Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph. -->

<!-- The Poem Problem -->

<p>In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored:</p>
 
<p>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.     <!-- This poem will display on a single line. -->

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</p>

<!-- The HTML <pre> Element -->

<p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>

<pre>
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.     <!-- The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text. he text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks. -->

   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
