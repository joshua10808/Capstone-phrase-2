<!-- HTML Headings -->

<h1>This is Heading 1</h1>     <!-- Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading. -->
<h2>This is Heading 2</h2>     <!-- Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold. -->
<h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is Heading 6</h6>

<!-- HTML Horizontal Rules -->

<h1>This is Heading 1</h1>     <!-- The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. -->
<p>This is some text.</p>      <!-- The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: -->
<hr>

<h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

<h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>

<!-- The HTML <head> Element -->

<!--
The HTML <head> element has nothing to do with HTML headings.
The <head> element is a container for metadata. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
The <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag:
-->

<head>
  <title>My First HTML</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>

<p>The HTML head element contains meta data.</p>     <!-- Note: Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information. -->
<p>Meta data is data about the HTML document.</p>


</body>
</html>
