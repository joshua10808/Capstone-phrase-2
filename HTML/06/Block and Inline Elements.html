The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

<!-- Block-level Elements -->

<!--
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
(stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Examples of block-level elements:

    <div>
    <h1> - <h6>
    <p>
    <form>
-->

<!-- Inline Elements -->

<!--
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
Examples of inline elements:

    <span>
    <a>
    <img>
-->

<!-- The <div> Element -->

<!--
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but both style and class are common.
When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content.
