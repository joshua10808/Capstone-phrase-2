<h2>What is Responsive Web Design?</h2>

<p>
Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones). <br>
Responsive Web Design is about using CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen
</p>

<p>Another way to create a responsive design, is to use a responsive style sheet, like W3.CSS.</p>

<h3>Resize this responsive page!</h3>
