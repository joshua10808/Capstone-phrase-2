<h1>HTML Layout Elements</h1>

<p> 
Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or newspaper). <br>
HTML5 offers new semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page. 
</p>

<p><img src="img_sem_elements.gif" alt="Image Missing" style="width:200px;height:250px;"></p>

<p>
&lt;header&gt; - Defines a header for a document or a section. <br>
&lt;nav&gt; - Defines a container for navigation links. <br>
&lt;section&gt; - Defines a section in a document. <br>
&lt;article&gt; - Defines an independent self-contained article. <br>
&lt;aside&gt; - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar). <br>
&lt;footer&gt; - Defines a footer for a document or a section. <br>
&lt;details&gt; - Defines additional details. <br>
&lt;summary&gt; - Defines a heading for the &lt;details&gt; element. <br>

<!-- HTML Layout Techniques -->

<!--
There are four different ways to create multicolumn layouts. Each way has its pros and cons:

    HTML tables
    CSS float property
    CSS framework
    CSS flexbox
-->

<h2>Which One to Choose?</h2>

<h3>HTML Tables</h3>

<p>
The &lt;table&gt; element was not designed to be a layout tool! <br>
The purpose of the &lt;table&gt; element is to display tabular data. <br>
So, do not use tables for your page layout! They will bring a mess into your code. <br>
And imagine how hard it will be to redesign your site after a couple of months. <br>
Tip: Do NOT use tables for your page layout!
</p>

<h3>CSS Frameworks</h3>

<p>If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.</p>

<h3>CSS Floats</h3>

<p>
It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. <br>
Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. <br>
Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.
</p>

<h3>CSS Flexbox</h3>

<p>
Flexbox is a new layout mode in CSS3. <br>
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. <br>
Disadvantages: Does not work in IE10 and earlier. <br>
